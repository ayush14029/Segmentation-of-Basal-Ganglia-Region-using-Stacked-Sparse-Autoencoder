train1 : The input layer of the model cosists of 200 nodes. A small Gaussian noise of variance 0.01 is added to the input data. 
train2 : The 2nd layer has 50 nodes. 
train3 : The third layer has 250 nodes to bring in sparsity. 
train4 : The last hidden layer has only 30 nodes to get a targetted result from features. 
Softmax : The output layer consists of the Softmax classifier and the backpropogation procedure.
